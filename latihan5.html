        <h2>Starbucks</h2>
        <p>Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. It was here
          where Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the
          world for our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the
          seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.
          <br>
          Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these doors and become captivated
          with Starbucks coffee from his first sip. After joining the company in 1982, a different cobblestone road
          would lead him to another discovery. It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy’s
          coffeehouses, and he returned to Seattle inspired to bring the warmth and artistry of its coffee culture to
          Starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones and embarked on our next chapter as a
          coffeehouse.
